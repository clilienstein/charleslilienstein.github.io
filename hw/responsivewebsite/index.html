                    <ul class="food-1-list">
                        <li>5 kaffir lime leaves, ribs removed, thinly sliced</li>
                        <li>3 California dried red chiles, soaked in water until soft, drained, seeds discarded, chopped</li>

                        <li>3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
                        <li>3 slices kacheay (also known as lesser ginger or lesser rhizome), peeled and chopped</li>
                        <li>3 shallots, thinly sliced</li>
                        <li>2 stalks lemongrass, bottom parts only, thinly sliced</li>

                        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon shrimp paste</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
                        <li>1 pound boneless skinless meaty white fish, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices</li>
                        <li>8 banana leaves</li>
                        <li>4 handfuls baby spinach leaves, or 4 young nyo leaves</li>
                        <li>4 fresh red chiles, cut lengthwise several times from the tip to 1/4 inch from the stem end</li>
                        <li>Steamed white jasmine rice, for serving</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="food-1-story">Pound together the lime leaves, red chiles, galangal, garlic, kacheay, shallots, lemongrass and turmeric, a few ingredients at a time, using a mortar and pestle until a fine paste forms. Mix together the kreung paste
                        with the coconut milk, chili paste, fish sauce, sugar, shrimp paste, salt and egg in a large bowl. Add the fish and combine well with the kreung paste marinade. Set aside and allow the marinade to infuse the fish, about 15 minutes. Set up
                        a
                        steamer. Make the banana leaf (konthoang) bowls by placing 2 banana leaves on top of each other and folding into little rectangular bowls with the tapered sides folded up and held together with bamboo toothpicks. Make 4 konthoangs total.
                        Make a bed of spinach leaves in the bottom of each konthoang. Divide the marinated fish between the bowls, and place on top of the spinach beds. Spoon 2 tablespoons of coconut milk over each serving of fish and top off with a fresh red
                        chile. Place the filled konthoangs (amoks) in the steamer and steam until the fish is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Enjoy with steamed white jasmine rice!</p>

                    <p class="food-3-story">Bring 4 liters of water to a boil in a large pot, along with a lemongrass stalk. Once boiling, add the chicken bone and cook for 10 minutes or until chicken is finished. Clean the mudfish or any freshwater fish
                        that you want to use for this recipe and place it in the boiling water. Don’t throw away the head of the fish, as it provides the most flavor for the broth. Let the chicken and the fish simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes. When the
                        chicken and the fish are cooked, cut them, and de-bone them both. Keep fish meat and chicken meat separate. Chop the rhizomes into thin slices, then crush them with a mortar and pestle with the roasted peanuts, the bird’s eye chili
                        pepper, and garlic. This mixture will guide the next step.Pound the chicken and the rhizomes mixture together to infuse the flavors. Pound until the chicken is completely crushed, then add the fish meat to the remaining mixture. Once
                        everything has been crushed into a coarse mixture, place it in a large bowl. Add the knorr chicken mixture, fish sauce, salt, sugar, and coconut milk to the bowl and mix thoroughly. Let the mixture sit for at least 10 minutes to infuse
                        all the flavor.For the somlar praheur, put 1 tablespoon of prahok liquid in a large pot with the broth and let it boil. Add prahok to any other flavoring ingredients to reduce its strong scent. Add the chicken and fish mixture once it
                        is cooked. Simmer for at least 10 minutes, adjust the broth to taste with salt and sugar.For the noodles, bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the rice noodle and let them cook for 4-6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside a bowl of
                        ice water.Once the noodles are cooked, pour out the water and place the noodle in a bowl filled with ice water. Start taking a handful of noodles and form them into serving portions, arrange them nicely in a bowl To eat, take 1 serving
                        of the rice noodle and place it in a pot. Add whatever fresh vegetables or wild greens you want, and top with some somlar praheur.
