                Cannabis For Dummies
            </h1>
            <p class="intro">When I was growing up, I had no idea what cannabis was. My parents always told me to stay away from "drugs", and that weed had all these horrible effects that could negatively impact my life. As I got older, I would frequently
                see videos and news articles talking about the benefits of medical cannabis. I would go to my best friend’s house and see his mother use cannabis to help her special needs son calm down from seizures. I watched a family relative use cannabis
                to relax his muscle spasms from Parkinson's disease. During a fall break I went out to California to visit some high school friends; that same night I had a paper due for one of my college classes. I remember getting stressed and signs of a
                panic attack began to appear. My friends took me to a dispensary, and I used a medical card to legally purchase cannabis for the first time. When I got back to their house, I consumed the strain that was suggested from the dispensary’s bud
                tender, and I realized my life had changed forever. My anxiety was instantly gone, and I was still able to function and focus on work. Since then, cannabis has helped me with my anxiety and controlling my ADHD. My mission is to change
                people’s attitude toward cannabis in order to help others. I want to educate the world about the benefits of cannabis as well as provide daily news post to keep people updated on what is going on in the industry. In the future I want to
                market cannabis; more specifically, I want to be involved in market research and consumer behavior. One of my main goals is to study women (specifically mothers) and cannabis, I want to find ways to introduce them into the cannabis space that
                is not only safe, but approachable for somebody who has never experienced cannabis. This is my dream.</p>

                    <p class="info-1">Hemp is a variety of the cannabis plant that contains little to no THC. It is completely non-psychoactive and has different uses than marijuana. Hemp refers to the fiber, hurd and seeds that are cultivated for industrial
                        purposes. Hemp seeds are used in dietary products and can be made into oil that is used for a variety of body care products. Hemp fiber is used to make clothing, rope and art. Hemp hurd, which is the outer core of the stem, is used with
                        cement and insulation. The cultivation and sale of hemp has recently become legal in the United States, but it should not be ingested in the same manner as marijuana.</p>

                    <p class="info-2">THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is one of the two primary compounds that occur naturally in the cannabis plant. It is a psychoactive compound, which means it is primarily responsible for creating the effects that are
                        associated with recreational cannabis use. These effects include hunger, relaxation, and altered senses of smell, sound and taste. THC is known to also have a number of medical purposes as it can help people that are experiencing nausea,
                        chronic pain or insomnia. Since THC is a mind-altering substance, it is recommended that people under the age of 18 do not consume cannabis as it can have harmful effects on memory and cognition.</p>

                    <p class="info-3">CBD or cannabidiol is the second primary compound that occurs naturally in the cannabis plant. Unlike THC, CBD is non-psychoactive, which means it will not change the mental state of a person after he/she has consumed it.
                        CBD is considered to have greater medical benefits than THC and has little to no recreational purpose. It has been found to help with Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Psoriasis, Schizophrenia, ADHD, and a number of other illnesses. CBD
                        can be consumed in the same manner as THC, but overall, CBD is thought to come with lower health risks and higher medical benefits.</p>

                    <p class="info-4">Cannabis sativa and Cannabis Indica are the two most common species of cannabis; each species differs in appearance, smell, and are known to produce different effects. In terms of appearance, the Sativa plant has leaves
                        that are long and thin and the plant itself is generally taller than that of the Indica species. Sativa generally has more energetic, creative effects than the Indica plant. It is best for daytime use and people that are seeking a more
                        stimulating and mind-altering experience. Some popular Sativa strains are: Haze, Durban Poison, and Maui Waui.</p>

                    <p class="info-5">Cannabis Indica is a species of cannabis that has several differences from the other popular species, cannabis Sativa. Unlike the tall and thin leaves of the Sativa plant, an Indica plant can be identified by its shorter
                        and wider leaves. Additionally, the Indica plant tends to be much smaller than the Sativa species. The common term “couch-lock” is often associated with the Indica plant because it produces strong effects of relaxation. Generally, Indica
                        affects the body more than the Sativa species, while Sativa affects the mind more than the Indica species. The effects that the Indica plant produces are best for people that are having trouble sleeping or want to relieve stress and
                        anxiety. Some popular Indica strains are: Skywalker, Master Kush, and LA Confidential.</p>

                    <p class="info-6">Hybrid marijuana is created when cannabis Indica and cannabis Sativa plants are crossbred. This mix of Sativa and Indica can produce hybrid strains that have some of the effects from both species of cannabis. Nevertheless,
                        hybrid cannabis is not always ½ Indica and ½ Sativa; certain strains may be heavily Indica with slight Sativa genetics or vice-versa. It is important that the user does research on specific hybrid strains because different combinations of
                        Indica and Sativa will produce different effects. Overall, hybrid cannabis is best for people that would like to have a balanced experience and enjoy feeling the effects of both the Indica and Sativa species. Some popular Hybrid strains
                        are: Gorilla Glue #4, Do-si-dos, and Tahoe OG.</p>
