                    <p class="art-info-1">I have been a huge fan of Kaws’ work ever since I started observing and collecting art. Kaws has been in the game for years and has shaped the world of art and hype beast culture. Over the years Kaws has done numerous
                        collaborations and sculptures featured around the world. While many say Kaws has become “mainstream” recently due to his art’s accessibility, many of his original acrylic paintings have sold for six figures.</p>

                    <p class="art-info-3">This is the most recent addition to our collection. We got this piece from Context Miami during Art Basel earlier this fall in 2019. This piece is titled "Blast" and uses various cut outs from comic books to create
                        this masterpiece. I like this one a lot because I believe it transitions so many different generations and mediums into one solid piece.</p>

                    <p class="art-info-4">This piece holds a special place in my heart because Frank Ocean is my favorite music artist. It was painted by Robin Velghe, also known as Rhymezlikedimez, and this was one of his first acrylic paintings. I was
                        fortunate to get to own one of his first acrylic pieces. Robin has done work with and for several famous hip-hop artist, and his work speaks for itself. Check him out on Instagram too!</p>
